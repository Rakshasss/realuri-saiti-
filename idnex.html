                <P id="pir-text"> The story of ‘’Ceramico’’ begins in 2014, from this small clay workshop, which was
                    <br>
                    located in just 170 square meters and had a collective of five people. Despite many <br>
                    difficulties that have arisen many times over the years, as a result of the great efforts <br>
                    and selfless work of each employee, multi-faceted ceramic wine bottles were created,<br>
                    and over a decade, the foundation was laid for the construction of our own enterprise, <br>
                    where today the best team is gathered around the beloved work. <br>
                    Its founder and CEO, an advertising specialist by profession, could never have <br>
                    imagined that he would start doing something completely different in this field. <br>
                    “At certain moments, I thought that I would not be able to cope with the work of this <br>
                    scale, but working with clay taught me to never give up and to fight to the end for what <br>
                    is important to me. Moreover, from today’s point of view, I think that this is the job that I <br>
                    love very much and it works best for me” he says. <br>
                    The variety and depth of clay proved very attractive, with its challenges and difficulties. <br>
                    Being an ancient and very interesting field in its origins, clay has endured decades and <br>
                    has preserved its uniqueness for many centuries. <br>
                    The demand for clay products is still relevant today in many areas. Clay pots have a <br>
                    special place in Georgian winemaking. <br>

                <P id="meore-text"> Our production is staffed with the best team, which allows us to produce quality
                    <br>
                    products. Over ten years we have made many friends as loyal customers. We are proud <br>
                    to cooperate with wine companies that are popular not only in Georgia, but also outside <br>
                    the borders of the country. We are glad that our products are competitive and occupy a <br>
                    place on store shelves in different countries of the world. <br>
                    In addition to the drinkware, since 2020 we have added new directions, we have started <br>
                    working on white clay and we are making beautiful products, we are working on <br>
                    individual orders. <br>
                    We also prepare a variety of flower pots with different clay. We beautify markets all over <br>
                    Georgia with our pots. In this business, the most interesting and fascinating thing is to <br>
                    interact with new and interesting people. <br>
                    I think the best people are gathered in our team. Clay has amazing power, it <br>
                    strengthens you, it charges you, and the work process is unified and harmonious. Clay <br>
                    taught us to take care of each other and we became one family. We study together, train <br>
                    each other and support each other. <br>
                    I try to create as free and friendly atmosphere as possible in our small family, our <br>
                    relationship is built on mutual respect. A thing created with love carries a completely <br>
                    different power. We are happy with the fact that with our noble work we make a small <br>
                    but useful contribution to the development of Georgian production. <br>
