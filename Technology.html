            For the preparation of ceramic products, in particular for making a drinkware, we are
            guided by a special recipe, the recipe for making the so-called ceramic mass. Which is <br>
            a mixture of raw materials, which is the basis of the ceramic body. In our case, we first
            weigh the crushed raw materials - clay and silt, then put them in a special kneading machine, <br>
            add liquid
            glass as an additive, water and start grinding, which lasts for 7-10
            hours. After mixing, we will get a schlicker. <br>
            We transfer the schlicker to storage rooms and pour it into molds of different shapes
            and sizes, through a specific technique, when the clay takes shape, the rest of the
            schlicker is poured back, <br>
            we try to harden it to the required condition, and then we open
            the tightly bound molds and start removing the already finished product according to the
            sequence. <br>
            Before being sorted for drying, the heads are worked to ensure the best
            possible heads for the plug. <br>
            It takes a few hours to dry the product, after which it begins to completely remove
            excess particles, straighten the seam area, the head and the base. Drying also helps <br>
            prevent deformation and cracking. Due to defects detected during drying, the product is
            returned to the kneading machine for processing. <br>
            The next stage is firing. The products are placed in the oven and baking begins, which
            may require different modes, depending on the condition of the products. Wine vessels <br>
            are fired at 1160 degrees, firing lasts for about 5-8 hours.
            Then the oven cools down. It is desirable to cool down by itself, without haste. <br>
            After complete cooling, we check the unpacked products by applying pressure on the
            compressor, so that the damaged ones can be selected and postponed. <br>
            The next stage is its coloring. This is the previous step before painting. This is
            necessary because most of the models are relief. As a result of coloring, we get a <br>
            contrast and a special effect.
            The last and no less important stage is its painting. For which we use different paints.
            As a result of painting, the product should be finished, get a final appearance, and <br>
            highlight the individuality of the product. Varnish is applied before packaging so that the color does not
            change during the <br>
            bottling of the wine.
            It is a rather time-consuming process, requiring the exact observance of technology in
            order to obtain a full-fledged product.
